Write a program that administers a basic addition quiz to the user. 
There should be ten questions. 
Each question is a simple addition problem such as 17 + 42, where the numbers in the problem are chosen at random. 
The program should ask the user all ten questions and get the user's answers. 
After asking all the questions, the user should print each question again, with the user's answer. 
If the user got the answer right, the program should say so; if not, the program should give the correct answer. 
At the end, tell the user their score on the quiz, where each correct answer counts for ten points.

The program should use three subroutines, one to create the quiz, one to administer the quiz, and one to grade the quiz. 
It can use three arrays, with three global variables of type int[], to refer to the arrays. 
  The first array holds the first number (a) from every question, 
  The second holds the second number (b) from every questions, and 
  The third holds the user's answers (a+b).


//Create and Administer the quiz:
//  Repeat this 10 times
//    Create a question
//    Ask question 
//    Get use answer
//    Calculate correct vlaue
//    Store correct value


//Grade the Quiz:
//   Print this 10 times
//     Print question
//     Print answer
//     Compare the answer with the correct values
//     If correct, say so
//     If not, give the correct answer
//  Calculate the score as below
//    Add all 10 answers scores (each one has 10 points)
//    Divide by 100
//    Print the final score
