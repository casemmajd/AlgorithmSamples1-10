Here is a function with return type String. 
This function has a String as parameter. 
The returned value is a reversed copy of the parameter. 
For example, the reverse of "Hello World" is "dlroW olleH". 
The algorithm for computing the reverse of a string, str, is to start with an empty string and then to append each character from str, starting from the last character of str and working backwards to the first:

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards, such as "radar". 
The reverse() function could be used to check whether a string, word, is a palindrome by testing "if (word.equals(reverse(word)))".
