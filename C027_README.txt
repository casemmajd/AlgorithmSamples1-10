/**
 *  A very simple drawing program that lets the user add shapes to a drawing
 *  area and drag them around.  An abstract Shape class is used to represent
 *  shapes in general, with subclasses to represent particular kinds of shape.
 *  (These are implemented as nested classes inside the main class.)  This
 *  program is an illustration of class hierarchy, inheritance, polymorphism,
 *  and abstract classes.  (Note that this program will fail if you add more
 *  than 500 shapes, since it uses an array of length 500 to store the shapes.)
