Let's do an example that shows how one subroutine can build on another. 
Let's write a subroutine that takes a String as a parameter. 
For each character in the string, it should print a line of output containing 25 copies of that character. 
It should use the printRow() subroutine to produce the output.


/**
 * Write one line of output containing N copies of the
 * character ch.  If N <= 0, an empty line is output.
 */

/**
 * For each character in str, write a line of output
 * containing 25 copies of that character.
 */
