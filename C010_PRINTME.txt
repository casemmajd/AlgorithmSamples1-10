Functions can return values of any type at all. 
Here's a function whose return value is of type boolean. 
It demonstrates some interesting programming points, so you should read the comments:

/**
 * This function returns true if N is a prime number.  A prime number
 * is an integer greater than 1 that is not divisible by any positive 
 * integer, except itself and 1.  If N has any divisor, D, in the range 
 * 1 < D < N, then it has a divisor in the range 2 to Math.sqrt(N), namely
 * either D itself or N/D.  So we only test possible divisors from 2 to 
 * Math.sqrt(N).
 */

        // We will try to divide N by numbers between 2 and maxToTry.
        // If N is not evenly divisible by any of these numbers, then 
        // N is prime.  (Note that since Math.sqrt(N) is defined to
        // return a value of type double, the value must be typecast 
        // to type int before it can be assigned to maxToTry.)
